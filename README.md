besides a dynamic site which updates, would be nice to have a collage generated upon push or update through githhub actions to keep on the repo and to have embedded inline.

if a person comes back and the collage image changes, they may have difficulty if they are looking in the same place and it is move, ergo, additional images need to probably be appended.

so collage 1 = 20 examples, 2 = another 20 examples, 3 = 8 examples at t = 2
then at t = 4 we can have 1 = 20 examples, 2 = another 20 examples, 3 = 20 examples, 4 = 18 exammples; so on and such forth
